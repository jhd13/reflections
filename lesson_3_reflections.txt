When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I would use a remote repository to:
    
    1. Collaborate with others.
    2. Work on multiple computers.
    3. Protect myself from data loss if my computer dies.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    On a team I don't know who is going to change what.
    Remote changes might conflict with my changes.
    Manual pull allows me to choose when I'm ready to accept someone else's changes locally,
    including doing that at a time that is a good stopping point for my other work.
